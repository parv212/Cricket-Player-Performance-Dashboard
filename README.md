# T20-World-Cup-2022-Best-11

In this project I created Power BI Dashboard that helps the user pick the Best 11 for the 2022 T20 Cricket Worldcup. This project was created with the help of CodeBasics. The Project contains 6 pages which show 5 essential orders of cricket format like powerhitters, middle order, finisher, allrounder and fast bowlers. The 6th page displays the best 11 which can be changed by the user as per requiremnets. Around 15 new measures were created which shows statistics of a player performance which were used to display top 5 cricketers for every group using the critireas displayed in the parameters file. Further, interactive tooltips were created which displays player stats for each match. This tooltip stats also change depending on the group.

The .pbix file contains the created Power BI reports used in this project. The DAX measures file contains the measures created for this particular project.
